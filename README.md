PROJECT ANALYSIS

Hipermedia project PART 1:

Final user:
Relating to this project the final user will be someone who is looking for someone to work for them, so, in this case the project will have to provide them with all the information related to:

Abilities with different tools and programs related to the sector I'm applying to.
Experience in the sector or in different work environments.
Reference to my abilities like a portfolio
Brief description
Some personal information such as where I live, my phone number or a way to contact me if the employer is interested in me.

As this project is intended to be a Curriculum Vitae it just provides all the information depicted above to the final user. 

Information architecture:

In this project the Information architecture is pretty straightforward because the only links that can get you to an outside page is to provide information of where to find my portfolio, everything else is found in the single page of information.

Visual design:

When it comes to visual design I decided to use a contrasted color palette, using dark for the header and a slightly lighter color for the side section on the left where there is a brief description of some information in white letters, but used a light blue like color for the separators i added to give more structure to the project, while maintaining the white background for the main information.

Color codes:
Header background: 0f0f0f
Side Section: 1d1a1a
Separator: AAA5D6

The typography used is Verdana, and the page layout is very simple, composed by 3 parts:
The header which contains the name and the qualifications i have, the side section which has all the information referring to where i live, phone number and some of the skills i have, and the main section which has a white background separated in 3 parts that are, a brief description of myself, where i studied and what qualifications i have and the experiences i had in the sector.
